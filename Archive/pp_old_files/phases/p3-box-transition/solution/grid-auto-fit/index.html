        <h1>Playing with CSS Grid... to "inject" a fullwidth grid item into a grid whose columns are
            <i>auto-arranged</i>
        </h1>
        <p>Imagine a grid of product cards, where clicking on a "quick view" button "injects" a new card that is
            expanded full width of the entire grid, immediately below the card that was clicked (thereby allowing a
            visual "connection" between the two cards), and is completely responsive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually, "quick views" are rendered as popups or overlays, but in this case, an "inline" solution is
                required.</li>
            <li>This mock-up requires very little CSS code to achieve it, and <strong>zero media queries</strong>.</li>
            <li>In reality, the "injected" card will probably be fetched via JavaScript and placed in the correct place
                in the DOM. However, for demo purposes, I've directly added the fullwidth cards in their correct
                positions in the DOM, and I'm simply toggling their visibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Accessibility considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML source order is preserved for the cards, providing a good natural tab order.</li>
            <li>The "quick view" buttons behave as "toggles", so they have <code>aria-expanded</code> and
                <code>aria-controls</code> attributes. See <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/">ARIA best practices - disclosure
                    widget</a> for more information.
            </li>
            <li>Focus management ensures the "injected" card can receive keyboard focus, and on closing the card,
                keyboard focus is returned to the button that originally toggled the card's visibility.</li>
